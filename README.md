# StoryWeb

StoryWeb is a project aimed to extract networks of entities from journalistic reporting. The idea is to reverse engineer stories into structured graphs of the persons and companies involved, and to capture the relationships between them.

StoryWeb consumes news articles as input data. Individual articles can be imported via the web interface, but there's also a possibility for bulk import using the [`articledata`](https://github.com/pudo/articledata) micro-format. One producer of `articledata` files is [`mediacrawl`](https://github.com/opensanctions/mediacrawl), which can be used to crawl news websites and harvest all of their articles.

## Installation

Storyweb can be run as a Python web application from a developer's machine, or via a docker container. We recommend using docker for any production deployment and as a quick means to get the application running if you don't intend to change its code.

### Running in Docker mode

You can start up the a docker instance by running the following commands in an empty directory:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opensanctions/storyweb/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

This will make the storyweb user interface available on port 8000 of the host machine.

### Running in development mode

Before installing storyweb on the host machine, we recommend setting up a Python virtual environment of some form (venv, virtualenv, etc.). 

As a first step, let's install the `spaCy` models that are used to extract person and company names from the given articles: 

```bash
pip install spacy
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python3 -m spacy download de_core_news_sm
python3 -m spacy download xx_ent_wiki_sm
python3 -m spacy download ru_core_news_sm
```

Next, we'll install the application itself, and its dependencies. Run the following command inside of a git checkout of the storyweb repository:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

You also need to have a PostgreSQL server running somewhere (e.g. on the same machine, perhaps installed via homebrew or apt). Create a fresh database on that server and point storyweb to it like this: 

```bash
export STORYWEB_DB_URL=postgresql://storyweb:storyweb@db/storyweb
# Create the database tables:
storyweb init
```

You now have the application configured and you can explore the commands exposed by the `storyweb` command-line tool:

```
Usage: storyweb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Storyweb CLI

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  auto-merge  Automatically merge on fingerprints
  compute     Run backend computations
  graph       Export an entity graph
  import      Import articles into the DB
  import-url  Load a single news story by URL
  init        Initialize the database
```

The `import` command listed here will accept any data file in the `articledata` format, which is emitted by the `mediacrawl` tool.

#### Running the backend API

Finally, you can run the backend API using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn --reload --host 0.0.0.0 storyweb.server:app
```

This will boot up the API server of port 8000 of the local host and enable hot reloads whenever the code changes during development. 

#### Installing and running the frontend

Once you have the API running, you can install and run the development server for the frontend. Storyweb uses React and ReduxToolkit internally and will use a Webpack dev server to dynamically re-build the frontend during development.

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install 
npm run dev
```

Remember that you need to run `npm run dev` whenever you do frontend development.
