"Critics cite the German regulator, press and investor community's tendency to rally around Wirecard against what they perceive as unfair attack.[43] Softbank invested in Wirecard with a €900m cash injection in 2019.[44] After the company's failure was made public, Softbank's executives blamed what they saw as failures on the auditor's part[45] and announced plans to sue EY for damages,[46] joining other efforts to launch legal actions against the auditor.[47][48] Regulators[edit] After initially defending BaFin's actions, its president Felix Hufeld later admitted the Wirecard scandal was a ""complete disaster"".[49] In response, the European Commission called for an investigation into whether BaFin broke EU rules on financial reporting.[28] Berlin announced plans to strengthen accounting regulations,[28] beginning by severing ties with the Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP), a quasi-official accounting watchdog, and transferring its duties to BaFin.[50][28] FT noted that FREP only had 15 employees and an annual budget of €6m.[51] FREP was thought to be too under-resourced to adequately audit Wirecard, and only concluded that the published accounts were inadequate after the company became insolvent.[51] Investors joined calls for union-wide regulation of market rules[52] and for an EU body in charge of regulatory actions.[53] On 1 September 2020, the German parliament announced that it would organise an inquiry in order to fully investigate the reasons why the government failed to prevent corporate fraud.[54] The scandal has highlighted the close ties between German politicians and Wirecard.[51] On 29 January 2021, Hufeld and deputy Elisabeth Roegele left BaFin as part of a plan to reform the agency.[55] Suspects[edit] Former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun was arrested shortly after his resignation.","Markus Braun","Wirecard","MANAGER"
"This was a result of Wirecard's taking only a small commission from its payment processing volume, and the transient payment flow through Wirecard's accounts was adjusted to reflect Wirecard's small cut.[13] In response, Wirecard retained the services of Schillings, a UK law firm, and FTI Consulting's public relations agency in London.[6] Later in 2015, J Capital Research published a report that recommended shorting Wirecard's stock, as it saw the company's Asian operations to be much smaller than claimed.[14] In 2016, a critical report published by a previously unknown entity named Zatarra Research led to share price crashes, prompting BaFin to launch an investigation into possible market manipulation.[11][15] In July 2021, Wirecard hired corporate investigations firm Alix Partners to perform a forensic investigation of the accounting practices that led to its insolvency.[16] Opaque acquisitions and corporate structure[edit] Critics point to Wirecard's global acquisitions as a means to mask trouble with organic growth by adding revenues from external sources, a tactic referred to as a rollup.","Wirecard","FTI Consulting","BUSINESS"
"After Markus Braun joined as CEO in 2002, the company focused on online payment services, starting with porn and gambling websites as clients.[5] By taking over the listing of InfoGenie AG, a defunct call centre group, Wirecard entered Neuer Markt stock market segment, an action that has been criticised as avoidance of proper scrutiny during an initial public offering.[6] This was achieved through a decision in an InfoGenie general meeting to transfer the non-listed Wirecard to InfoGenie AG by way of a capital increase against investment in kind, making Wirecard a stock corporation listed in the Prime Standard stock market segment through a reverse IPO.","Markus Braun","Wirecard","MANAGER"

"In 2015, Wirecard purchased an Indian payments group for €340m, despite the founders of those businesses failing to raise funding while valuing their key assets at €46m.[17] Wirecard responded to the reports by claiming that its payment technologies were superior and arguing that the rapid growth of the cashless fintech industry justified such valuations.[18] A series of deals involving Wirecard's “buy and build” strategy, which intended to buy customers for the company's payment services, were criticized as being structured in an unusual manner, resulting in difficulty in verifying €670m of intangible assets.[19] In 2018, the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation (now the Foundation for Financial Journalism) concluded after a seven-month investigation that according to documents filed, at least €175m from Wirecard's €340m purchase of an India-based payment processor in October 2015 were not transferred to the seller.[12] Artificial inflation of profit[edit] In January 2019, Financial Times reported on irregularities uncovered by Wirecard's Singapore investigation, which began in March 2018 internally but a whistleblower feared was being squashed.","Singapore","India","WITHIN"
